In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecture, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

## Basics

- Q&A Forum: Piazza [https://piazza.com/eng.ucsd/spring2021/cse11/](https://piazza.com/eng.ucsd/spring2021/cse11/)
- Gradescope: [https://www.gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com) [an invitation will be sent in the first week]
- Autograder: [https://autograder.ucsd.edu/](https://autograder.ucsd.edu/)

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 4-6 hours on videos,
reading, lecture, and discussion; 2-3 hours on programming practice; and 4-6
hours working on your programming projects. If you find yourself spending
dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the course staff
and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

<a id="b:lec"></a>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

Lecture content will be presented through live lecture and readings. All lectures will be recorded.  Attendance is encouraged but
not required. 

These will come with associated quizzes that are due on the following
Monday, Wednesday or Friday at the start of the first originally-scheduled lecture time (8am San Diego time). The
quizzes are required work to demonstrate your consistent engagement with the
material. 

The lecture times are listed below (in the time zone of San Diego). 
Zoom links for the lectures will be posted in Canvas.

<h3>Schedule</h3>

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. If you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you’ll know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we’ll strive to be up to date with the current week.

## Staff & Resources

### Staff
<a id="staff"></a>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://gregmiranda.com">Greg Miranda</a> (Instructor)
</p>

There are 14 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your learning, and a few kinds of help sessions
you can attend. 

The first is **1-on-1 help hours** where TAs and tutors are available to
answer your questions about any course content, though often this is a good
place to go for programming help. At the times below, the course staff will be
available to answer your questions, and it's a great place to get debugging
help, since you'll be able to 1-on-1 screenshare with a tutor.

Expect to have about 5 minutes with a tutor or TA: you probably won’t have the solution at the end of the conversation, but you should feel un-stuck and ready to try new approaches.

You can see instructions for how we're setting this up for remote access here:

[Remote Lab Hours How-To](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15D8Z3re9gYDfcIGQSX7r7fc0LZBzY9cA/view?usp=sharing)

These rules help us make sure we get timely and actionable help to as many
students as possible. They also encourage students to do some meaningful work
on their own before reaching out for help – the goal of the course is for you
to be able to do programming work on your own!

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_kulptphaqshnppicbrk3v0rhl8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles&amp;src=Y18wcmxsaW8yOTgzcnZyazIzbDZvNDJrOTlpc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&amp;src=ZW4udXNhI2hvbGlkYXlAZ3JvdXAudi5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&amp;color=%23EF6C00&amp;color=%230B8043&amp;mode=WEEK&amp;showTz=1&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showNav=1&amp;showTabs=1" style="border:solid 1px #777" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The second is through **Piazza**.

Piazza is an online discussion board where we can make announcements and
students can ask questions. Both we (the course staff) and your classmates can
answer your questions. There are a few kinds of questions you should ask on
Piazza:

- Private questions about your code related to a programming assignments
- Private questions about your grade / progress in the course
- Public questions about the content of lecture, discussion, lab, and any readings
- Public questions containing no code that relate to programming assignments

For each assignment, you will find a Frequently Asked Questions post, where we
will answer all common questions we receive in office hours and via (private)
Piazza posts. If you ask a question that’s already answered in that post, we’ll
likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new
important questions and answers come in.

When answering questions, be polite, be clear, and assume the best intentions
of the person asking. If it turns out you make a mistake or were wrong, admit
it with a smile (emoji are great for this 😊), and make sure the correct
information is clear. Above all, keep in mind that the course is a community
whose goal is to foster a positive learning environment for everyone.

For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official!
They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by accident. “My
classmate said so on Piazza” is not a legitimate justification in most
arguments, though they may indeed lead you in helpful directions.

<a id="grading"></a>
## Grading

There are three components to your grade in the course:

- 20% Engagement (surveys, lecture quizzes, etc)
- 50% Programming Assignments (weekly)
- 30% Exams (Code + video), 2 midterms + final
  - Best exam performance counts for 15%
  - Middle exam counts for 10%
  - Lowest exam counts for 5%
  - To pass the course, you must either pass:
    - Both midterms, or
    - The final exam

Your final letter grade will correspond to the following table:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr align="center" padding="10">
<td>A+</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>A-</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>D, F</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>&nbsp; >97&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 93-96.99 &nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 90-92.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 87-89.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 83-86.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 80-82.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 77-79.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 73-76.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 65-72.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; Below 64.99&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on a number of
factors that we will not publicize), but we guarantee that we will not adjust
the scale to make it harder to get a better grade. We will not adjust the
scale for individual students.

<a id="g:engage"></a>
<h3>Engagement</h3>

Each lecture will come with an associated quiz. Completing the quiz before the
next lecture section (8am San Diego time) with at least half of the answers correct gains engagement
credit. You can also get engagement credit by submitting various surveys and
other small engagement tasks we may ask of you throughout the quarter.

You need to get credit for 80% (ex: 29 out of 36 total) quizzes, surveys, or tasks for full engagement credit.

<a id="p:programming"></a>
<h3>Programming</h3>

Most weeks there will be a programming assignment. Direct practice with
programming will make up the majority of your work in the course.

Each programming assignment will have a portion that is automatically graded, and a portion that is manually graded by the course staff.

After each assignment's deadline, we will open a resubmission for that assignment for two weeks (this time period may be shorter for assignments near the end of the quarter). You can resubmit to improve your grade. The details of this process will be described along with the grades for the first programming assignment.

There are 10 PAs total, and their relative weightings that add up to 50% are:

- PA0.5: 1%
- PA1: 4%
- PA2: 5%
- PA3: 6%
- PA4: 7%
- PA5: 6%
- PA6: 3%
- PA7: 8%
- PA8: 5%
- PA9: 5%

<a id="g:exams"></a>
<h3>Exams</h3>

In place of on-paper exams, we will follow a different procedure for “exams”
this quarter.

Twice during the quarter and once at the time of the final exam, we will give
you a short programming assignment that you must complete in a short time frame
(2-3 days) without any help from other people, including the course staff. You
can use any resources, notes, readings, and past code from the course to help
in addition to Web-based resources.  Along with submitting the program, you
will record a short video of yourself presenting the program you wrote,
demonstrating its behavior and your understanding. We'll give some
opportunities for practice with this process, and much more detailed
instructions with the exam release.

The first time will be in **week 6**, with Thu/Fri/Sat as the days to complete
it (right after PA5, May 6-8). The second time will be in **week 9** with
Thu/Fri/Sat as the days to complete it (May 27-29). The last time will be for a
few days around our final exam dates (June 9-11).

We **do not** expect that the programming work and recording will take three
days of constant work. The tasks will be significantly shorter than the PAs, so
this should only take a few hours. We give the broad range to give you the best
chance to schedule some quiet, focused time to do the work and record the
presentation.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video – many students are concerned that cheating will
be frequent in all-remote courses, and this is our way of ensuring that we are
giving grades to the people who earned them.

We will delete all the videos we receive from you after assigning final grades
for the course, and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory during the quarter only accessible to the course staff.

Please send a private message on Piazza or an email to the instructor if you
have concerns about this exam policy or cannot complete exams in this style for
some reason.


<a id="policies"></a>
## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Individual assignments will describe their academic integrity requirements.
This have a [missive on academic integrity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6tu-82W5kFkEkZG8n4F7p-MLhyFVWLdPw5Tm1fABfM/edit?folder=1jNMUNlJuyXaOxDE5MdNNfRFARxfP40Rr#)
has some details some examples of what we expect in terms of collaboration in the
course.

Note that with the course remote, one challenge we face as an instructional
team is verifying that students are submitting their own work. We typically use
exams to mitigate this particular challenge to academic integrity, since it
requires an in-person, ID-checked assessment. Assignments and exams will come
with specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but we have
one course-wide policy – we may reach out to students to schedule a check-in on
their understanding of work they've submitted if we're suspicious about an
academic integrity violation. This would involve a videoconference with a TA or
instructor to check that the student has the understanding demonstrated by
their work.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### Late and Missed Work

There will be opportunities to regain some (not necessarily all) lost credit on programming assignments if you submit something incomplete or miss the deadline, by resubmitting later with fixes. The details of this process will be described along with the grades for the first programming assignment.

No late work will be accepted for the programming exams. However, the combined grading policy for the exams will allow some flexibility in the event that you cannot complete one of them. 

### Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.


### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.

### Consent to Participate in Educational Research

University of California, San Diego
Consent to Act as a Research Subject
Investigating the Impact of Pedagogical Choices on University Student Learning and Engagement

**Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?**

Gabriele Wienhausen, Director of the Teaching and Learning Commons, together
with her education research colleagues is conducting a research study to find
out more about how pedagogical choices affect student learning and experience
in the classroom. You have been asked to participate in this study because you
are a student in a class that is being studied or used as a control. There will
be approximately 500,000 participants in this study.

**Why is this study being done?**

The purpose of this study is to create knowledge that has the potential to
improve the learning and educational experience of students at UC San Diego and
beyond.

**What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?**

If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:

Your data from this class including grades, homework and exam submissions, and
survey responses will be included in the analysis to determine the
effectiveness of the pedagogical techniques used in this course compared to
other similar courses.

**How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?**

Your participation involves only agreeing to let us use your data in our
analysis.  It will require no time on your part above the time you put into
this course without agreeing to the study.

**What risks are associated with this study?**

Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include the following:

1.   A potential for the loss of confidentiality.   We will not share your
personally identifying data with people outside our research team.  Data will
only be kept in anonymized form for research purposes.  Course data will not be
used for this research study until after final grades have been posted and will
be rendered confidential by removing any identifiers before analysis.  Your
instructor will not know whether or not you are participating in this study
until after final grades have been posted.  Data from students who opt out of
the study will be removed prior to data analysis.  Research records will be
kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may be
reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.

Since this is an investigational study, there may be some unknown risks that
are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new
findings.

**What are the alternatives to participating in this study?**

The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate.   If
you choose to opt-out of participating in this research study, we will exclude
your data from analysis.  Whether you participate will have no impact on your
experience or grade in the associated class as the professor will not know who
is or is not participating in the study until after final grades are assigned.

**What benefits can be reasonably expected?**

There is no direct benefit to you for participating in the study. The
investigator, however, may learn more about how to improve student learning,
and society may benefit from this knowledge.

**Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?**

Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate
or withdraw or refuse to answer specific questions in an interview or on a
questionnaire at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are
entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study
before the end of the quarter, simply respond to the online opt-out form here:
https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2.  If you decide to opt out after the
quarter has ended, you must contact Laurel Nelson (laureln@ucsd.edu) and give
the quarter and the course from which you would like your data withdrawn.  You
will be told if any important new information is found during the course of
this study that may affect your wanting to continue.

**Can you be withdrawn from the study without your consent?**

The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels it is
in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be
withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the
study personnel.

**Will you be compensated for participating in this study?**

You will not be compensated for participating in this study.

**Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?**

There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.

**Who can you call if you have questions?**
